# MyReads Project

## Project Overview

This is my submission for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. This is the MyReads website that enables you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading or want to read. The first screen shows the books in the three different categories which include "Currently Reading", "Want to Read", and "Read". The books can be moved to different categories by using the green dropdown button shown on the book cover. The book details can be viewed in a modal pop-up by clicking on the book cover. Books can be added to you collection by clicking on the green button with the plus sign in the bottom right corner of the screen. The search screen will be displayed that lets you search for new books to add to your collection. 

**Note: Functionality was added to show a Modal pop-up displaying details of the book. Click on the book cover to see the modal pop-up with the details.**
