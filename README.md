# MyReads Project

## Project Overview

This is my submission for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. This is the MyReads website that enables you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading or want to read. 

**Note: Functionality was added to show a Modal pop-up displaying details of the book. Click on the book cover to see the modal pop-up with the details.**

The following steps need to be followed:

1) Clone or download project in a directory from Github https://github.com/sscanni/My-Read-Project

The project was bootstrapped using https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app.
